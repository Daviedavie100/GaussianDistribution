#A tar.gz file, ie an sdist, contains the files needed to compile(opens in a new tab) and 
#install a Python package. A .whl file, ie a built distribution, only needs to be copied to 
#the proper place for installation. Behind the scenes, pip installing a .whl file has fewer 
#steps than a tar.gz file.
